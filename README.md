# Social Netowrk API with NoSQL

## Description

This application is an api that will serve a user JSON objects if queryied on the correct routes, and that allows a user to create users, thoughts(posts), and reactions to those posts. It has full CRUD functionality, although not every use case is handled. 

In this project, I wanted to expand my understanding of database technologies. I already had some experience with SQL databases, so NoSQL was a nice next step. I used MongoDB, mongoose, and Express in this project.
